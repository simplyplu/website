HOW TO ADD YOUR MP3 FILES:
============================

1. Place your MP3 file in this folder (audio/)
2. Name it exactly: woo1.mp3
3. That's it! The website will automatically find and play it.

To add more beats:
- Add more beat cards in beats.html following the same structure
- Name your MP3 files accordingly (e.g., woo2.mp3, woo3.mp3)
- Update the audio source in the HTML to match your file name
